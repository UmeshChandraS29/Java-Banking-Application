# Java-Banking-Application
The Java Banking Application is a console-based system developed using Core Java that allows users to perform basic banking operations such as creating an account, depositing money, withdrawing funds, and viewing account details.

This project is designed to demonstrate the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), File Handling, and Exception Handling in Java. It provides a simple and effective way to simulate real-world banking functionalities through a text-based interface.

The system stores account information using file serialization, allowing data to persist even after the program is closed. Each account has a unique account number, customer name, and balance. Users can interact with the system via a menu-driven interface.
